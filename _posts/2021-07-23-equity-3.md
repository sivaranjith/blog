I would like to speak about 5 Index funds
1. Nifty 50 Index fund
2. Nifty Next 50 Index fund
3. Nifty 100 Index fund
4. S&P 500 Index fund
5. NASDAQ Index fund

# Nifty 50:

If you want to invest in the most valued company in Indian NSE, then Nifty 50 has those companies for you! So the risk/return will be less compared to other index funds.

The index value was 848 in 1/1/1996 and 15,854 on 1/7/2021, so the CAGR (Yearly interest) seems to be around 12.13%. Similarly index was at 1546 on 1/1/2000, which yields CAGR of 11.39% in the last 21 years. Similarly index was at 4882 on 1/1/2010, which yields CAGR of 10.70% in the last 11 years.

# Nifty Next 50:

I like to look at the Nifty 50 as a set of companies like a well developed companies, where are as Nifty Next 50 are like set of companies are fighting to reach that state. So their risk/return will be slightly higher than Nifty 50.

This index value was 1068 at 1/1/1997 and it is valued at 38,874 on 1/7/2021, so the CAGR (Yearly interest) seems to be around 15.75%. Similarly index was at 4352 on 1/1/2000, which yields CAGR of 10.68% in the last 21 years. Similarly index was at 9985 on 1/1/2010, which yields CAGR of 12.45% in the last 11 years.

# Nifty 100:

Even though it encloses the companies from both Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50 together, it is not an alternative to putting your investment in those two funds individually. For this we have to understand how our money is getting invested across various companies in a given index fund. Lets talk about Nifty 50 first, the amount we invest will be distributed across these 50 companies, the weightage with which each it is getting distributed depends on the valuation of the company in that list. For example say first company dominate Nifty 50, say around 40% of evaluation of comes from this company, in that case the our 40% of investment will go to this one company. Similarly all the companies will get their share depending on their evaluation.

In real world there will be some N companies dominating Nifty 50 and M companies will be dominating Nifty Next 50. But when it comes to Nifty 100 these N companies from Nifty 50 will dominate remaining Nifty 50 companies and also, all the companies from Nifty Next 50.

Hence Nifty 100 becomes more resistant to fluctuation mean it is less risky & less in returns than splitting the investment amount equally across Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50. This index value was 2605 at 1/11/2005 and it is valued at 16,091 on 1/7/2021, so the CAGR (Yearly interest) seems to be around 12.26%. Similarly index was at 4,822 on 1/1/2010, which yields CAGR of 10.96% in the last 11 years.

# S&P 500:

This is the first index fund start across the world, I was started in America by [John C. Bogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle) with his mutual fund company called The Vanguard Group. It is said that he wanted to create a fund which had a minimum expense ratio (broker fee).

This Index fund has top-500 companies from American stock exchange. You can take a look at its [Return by year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500#Returns_by_year). Since it has 500 companies it is very stable. There are Mutual fund companies like Motilal Oswal who helps to invest in these funds. **The harder to predict thing for us is, the Dollar to Rupee conversion rate**. Even if you get a good return because of the currency conversion rate, you might lose money. <u>I don't clearly understand how this works and how taxation works in this case. If and when I find this, I will update it here!</u>

This index value was 89.63 at 1/3/1970 and it is valued at 4,297.5 on 1/6/2021, so the CAGR (Yearly interest) seems to be around 7.84%. During 1970 seems like dollar to rupee conversion ratio is 7.5 but as of 14/07/2021 this conversion ratio is 74.52; so we would have got return because of this also.

Similarly index was at 1394.5 on 1/1/2000, which yields CAGR of 5.37% in the last 21 years. Dollar to Rupee conversion ratio is 44.94 on the year 2000.

Similarly index was at 1074 on 1/1/2010, which yields CAGR of 12.81% in the last 11 years. Dollar to Rupee conversion ratio is 45.73 on the year 2010.

# NASDAQ

NASDAQ is based on the American Stock market. So it will have similar cautions/positives which I previously stated for S&P-500. It uses a market capitalization weighting methodology. So it mostly will have top performing companies, so the risk/return is high in this case. As of march 2020, it is dominated by Technology sector which has 48% and Consumer services has 20% and Health care has 10% and the remaining is split across much more categories.

This index value was 140 at 1/4/1980 and it is valued at 14,504 on 1/6/2021, so the CAGR (Yearly interest) seems to be around 11.93% (1USD to INR in 1980 is 7.86). Similarly index was at 3940 on 1/1/2000, which yields CAGR of 6.25% in the last 21 years. Similarly index was at 2147 on 1/1/2010, which yields CAGR of 18.07% in the last 11 years.

Note:

Always choose the "Direct" plan option when you are starting to invest in mutual fund, because regular means someone from the house is helping you, so you will pay more expense ratio, which means less return for us. So never choose "Regular" always "Direct" as your plan type.

Also always choose "Growth" (even over "dividend reinvestment") instead of "dividend payout" so that the interest amount is reinvested and you get the compounding effect. But if you want to take out the dividend then in that case go for dividend payout approach.
