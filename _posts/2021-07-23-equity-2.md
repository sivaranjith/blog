# Impact of compounding effect

Before understanding which among this is a better place to start, let us form a consensus on the basics of self finance!

Everyone one of us likes to have a good amount of wealth. So for this we need money. But working on your own to become rich is not possible in this current world. You need many others to work for you. These workers can be of two types namely, fellow human and money.

Earning money with the help of money is the most simplest but strongest way of dealing with things. Money always goes to people who have large money. (I am saying this in a world where capitalistic views are dominant. It doesn't matter if we like it or not. But this is how things happen in today's world).

Since we starting speaking growth, we can't avoid the topic of Compounding effect. Einstein calls this as the 8th wonder of the world. Compound effect can be defined as putting in small changes every day, will give large result in long time! There will be a point till which you will not see great change/return but beyond that point the results will be sky-high. This point is called the <u>Tipping point</u>. So we have to wait till we cross the tipping point to see great results. This applies to finance, building knowledge, becoming good at arts/sports, etc. The below images show the compounding effect in terms of numbers.

So we must put in our money where it can safely get compounded.

# How compouding works

Now lets look at the compounding interest formula

![Compound interest formula](https://img.money.com/2021/01/compound-interest-formula.jpg?quality=60)

There are two things here to get better compounding effect.
1. No of years for which we invest (t)
2. Rate at which we get interest (r)

The principal amount here doesn't speed up the compounding effect. It just increases the scale. Hence, we can go two ways from here:
1. If you go after a higher rate of interest then with a small investment period you can get the compounding effect working, thus you will get a large Amount. But the risk is high in this case! Because the rate of interest is high, it will be hard for the borrower to repay.
2. If you go after longer investment period then with a small investment period you can get the compounding effect working, thus you will get a large Amount. But the risk is low in this case! Because the rate of interest is low, it will be easy for the borrower to repay.

To be rich is not enough that your principal earns interest. Your first level interest also must generate second level interest. But that is not good enough. Your second level interest also must generate third level interest. But that is not good enough. Your third level interest also must generate fourth level interest. But that is not good enough. Your fourth level interest also must generate fifth level interest. The more levels you go to, the easier you become rich! This is like a tree, the deeper it goes, the better it is for us.

So it is a marathon instead of a short sprint. It is about sustaining for a long time, without falling down. So I want to choose an option where the returns will be guaranteed to be good in the long term. Hence I want to stick with a less risk fund like an index fund.

# How good is an index fund?

Let us take the answer from Warren Buffett, the following is his view on Index fund.

> By periodically investing in an index fund, the know-nothing investors can outperform most investment professionals.

He proved this by making a bet against a mutual fund manager. Where Warren Buffett will invest only in S&P-500 (American index fund) and the mutual fund manager will manage a portfolio actively. The time period for this is 10 years. Warren Buffett won this bet.

The problem here is there will be cases, where you will have a fund which performs better than our Index fund but this will last only for 5-8 years max. Anand Srinivasan says, only 10-20% of the fund will beat index fund in a given year.

Now lets see the returns for BSE index fund in the past 45 years. Each column ranging from 1-30 years mean, if you invest in index fund for that long, how much percentage you would have got in returns. Look at last row, when the no of invested period grows, the range of return becomes less oscillating meaning much safer for us. Hence the usual saying, **The market is unpredictable in the short-term but somewhat clearly predictable in the long-term**. Also, the probability of loss percentage becomes zero percentage if your investment time period is above 15 years. (this is the case in the past, it need not be true for the future. But nothing wrong in having hope I guess).

![BSE 500 past performance](https://investingfunda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-2.49.48-PM.jpeg)

Let's come to the 72% rule. Which states that if you divide 72 by your rate of interest, you will get time in which your returns will be doubled. So let's assume we will invest for 30 years, so now the range of return might be between 13% to 18%, so lets assume on average get a return of 15% year on year. That means 72/15=4.8. Which means for every 4 years and 10 months our amount will be doubled. Let's round of this time period as 5 years. So if we are investing for long timer period like 30 years, we can expect doubling effect once 5 years.

![BSE 500 forecast with past performance]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/bse_500_forcast_with_past_performance.png)

Let me explain this table, In the above setting we found if we invest for 30 years are more on average we can expect 15% year on year interest rate. With that we found every 5 years the amount will get doubled. So The first column has rows incremented in terms of 5 years. In the amount column, the amount is doubled for each row above it. The last column says in how much time our initial amount (1 rupee) gets doubled if we stick for the no of years that we have specified in that row. The Inflation value column shows how much a rupee will be due to inflation for that specific amount of time from today. The last column will show how much the amount column value is worth in today's world. I have used 6% as average inflation rate, which I feel I good enough to bet against.

It is also clear that 25 years is the tipping point for this table, beyond which the return goes sky rocketing. It is about sticking with the index fund for such a long time. So my plan is to invest for 10 years on a monthly basis and to not touch the fund for another 20-30 years. I believe this to be a good basket to have in our retirement planning. (we must have other baskets also)

I have attached sample investment amounts for the plan I have stated. If I invest Rs 500 for 120 months (10 years) then I will have 1,39,329 (77,800 in today's value). Which I leave to compound silently for next 20 years I will have 22,80,333 (3,97,030 in today's value). But instead I choose another 10 years (30 years after completing the initial 10 years of monthly investment) then I will have 92,25,220 (8,96,896 in today's value). Remember my actual investment was for just 60,000 rupees. Remember these values are calculated under the assumption you are ready to wait for 30 years. Time is the key point.

Thus an Index fund is a very stable and strong option if you would like to have a good planning for your retirement. Lets assume you will get married and lets assume you choose to have child. If you can invest 1 Lakh in today's index fund, it will get compound to 10 Crores when they are 50 years old and 40 crores when they are 60 years old. I am saying this because many of us save a lot for the next generation. It is better to use time in your favor, nothing can beat time and the compound effect. So that your child need not worry about their retirement savings. They can choose to live their life without the burden of retirement savings.

Another important thing is knowing when to liquidate the fund. It is better to have a 5 year time period to liquidate the fund. I don't think we can choose a random day to liquidate the fund and think we will have the best returns. By seeing for last 30 years we can see that, at least once 10 years we are having recession. So if you happened to pick the wrong time where recession on going it won't be advisable. So if we have 5 years time period to pick from, then we can choose a time when the market is high depending on when was the last recession and how the market is performing now.

Also this is why it is really hard for us to get into the brackets of people who are rich for generations, because we will be fighting against 100 years+ of compounding effect.
